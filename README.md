### TODO:
* Stuff

# WIP - To run this project you:
## Web:
* Add file 'web/resources/js/firebase_config.js' with firebase info.
  * PM me
* flutter run -d chrome
* r - for reloading (might cause error when reloading, known issue, needs to be solved)

### Extra:
* Might have to manually add SEO stuff on the index.html file
  * Because web is web, and the index file is mostly empty until the js is loaded, meaning search engines will see nothing.
